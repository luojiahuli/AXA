## AXA - Driver Telematics Challenge

This was a [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/axa-driver-telematics-analysis) I entered. The aim of the challnge was to find an algorithmic signiture of driving type. Ideally this "telematic fingerprint" should be capable of distinguishing when a trip was driven by the said driver. 

I was provided with a dataset of over 50,000 driver trips to work with. This repository contains all code for the exploratory data analysis, feature building and modelling phases. The data, is not included, but can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/axa-driver-telematics-analysis/data).

I finished in a top 25% position. The final model used was a [GBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) run against a dataset with many new features added to it.
